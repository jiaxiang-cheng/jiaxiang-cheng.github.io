[//]: # (## Curriculum Vitae of Jiaxiang Cheng)
### Biography

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, 
focusing on machine learning for prognostics and health management in industrial systems. 
My research journey has been primarily within [Project 3: Failure Mode Analysis](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spgroup-ntu/research-focus/thrust-c---project-3) 
at [SP Group-NTU Joint Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spgroup-ntu), where I've had the privilege to contribute since its inception.

During my involvement in the project, I have had the opportunity to develop various statistical models 
and explore deep learning techniques to improve the reliability analysis of power equipment. 
One of our collaborative research papers was honored with the 
[Best Paper Award](https://phmap.jp/program-award/)  at the 4th Asia Pacific Conference 
of the Prognostics and Health Management Society (PHMAP 2023) in Tokyo, Japan, 
held from September 11th to 14th, 2023.
